BSUIR 2023 diploma project. 

<strong>Description</strong>

The goal was to develop a desktop application for testing students and university members.
I've used ReactJS, TypeScript, ElectronJS, AntD, SCSS, SQLite 3.

This version is for professor, it's includes admin panel to manage tests, theory and exercises PDF materials. 
For development I spent around 4 months of parttime work. While development I've worked in the company at fulltime load.

<strong>This app was included to the educational program.</strong>
Now it's testing in university by teachers. Not the final option.

At the diploma comission I've got 8/10 score. Head teacher of my department gave me a 9/10.
